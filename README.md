## What?
Vim configuration repository designed to be used via
[vcsh](https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh), a git based aggregating configuration
manager for homedirs.

* Backs up files to `.orig` before overwriting.
* Automatically installs necessary haskell dependencies via stack.
* Tested on Mac and Linux
* Based on [haskell-vim-now](https://github.com/begriffs/haskell-vim-now).

## How?
To use this configuration you just need to run this command:

```
vcsh clone https://github.com/harendra-kumar/config-vim.git
```

### Pre-requisites
Make sure that you have Haskell `stack` installed.

## Suggestions
Any fixes, suggestions on better configuration options are welcome!
